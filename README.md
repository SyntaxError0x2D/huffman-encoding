# huffman-encoding
My attempt to implement a simple version of huffman encoding.

## Todo:
- Proper header for the file 
- Include the byte map in the same file as the binary.
- Deal with the filler data.
- Resizable nodes
- Resizable read / writing size. (reading byte by byte atm, might be inefficient)
